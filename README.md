Event Ticket System is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that revolutionizes how events are created and tickets are sold. By leveraging smart contracts and the ERC-721 NFT standard, this platform allows event organizers to create and manage events, while enabling users to securely purchase, own, and verify digital tickets in a transparent and tamper-proof way.

üîç Key Features:
Decentralized Event Creation: Organizers can easily create events with custom pricing, dates, and ticket counts.

Secure Ticket Purchase: Users buy tickets directly from the smart contract using ETH.

NFT Ticketing: Each ticket is a unique ERC-721 token, verifiable on-chain and transferable.

Instant Payouts: Organizers receive ETH instantly upon ticket purchase.

Fraud-Proof System: No fake tickets, double-booking, or central manipulation.

Optional Metadata Storage: Store ticket details (seat, QR, etc.) via IPFS or other decentralized storage.

üîó Tech Stack:
Blockchain: Pharos Devnet

Smart Contracts: Solidity, OpenZeppelin ERC-721

Frontend (optional): Next.js, Ethers.js/Web3.js for wallet integration

Storage: IPFS (for ticket metadata)
